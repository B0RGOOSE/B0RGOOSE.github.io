    <h1>My CSC 106 Avatar!</h1>
    <p>Remember what I said in my about me section about my online persona? This is... not at all her- this is the little avatar I made for my csc 106 course! She's made 100% in java script :3c </p>

    <h2>Avatar Dance! (The Ashley Dance!)</h2>
    <p id="dancetext"> This little silly program makes my avatar dance around the scrren! As it stands, to get my avatar to move around, just hit the reset button! Of course, this lil silly dance is made in 100% Javascript. I will likely say that for every program going forward- I like saying that.</p>

    <h2>Ashley Racing a Fish?!</h2>
    <p>Well well well, Ashley and the fish finally decided to settle their differences by a good old fashioned race... The outcome of the race is random every time! Just hit the reset button, and the fish and Ashley will start to race again! ...100% MADE IN JAVASCRIPT- BOOM- I SAID IT- YEAH-</p>
    <iframe id="avatar_racing" src="https://code-lab.app/program/084ac25d-5190-4021-8584-4e879cb4fadd/embed" style="min-height: 500px; min-width: 400px; border: none; "></iframe>

    <h2>Ashley goes insane- I mean makes her avatar dance... WITH FUNCTIONS</h2>
    <p>Have you ever considered that sometimes things are long? ... I have, and we made them both longer and shorter by making the exact same program of my avatar dancing... but with Functions!!!! Same rules as before, click restart and watch my avatar do a lil dance, made of course in 100% Javascript, as the food people would say! </p>
    <iframe src="https://code-lab.app/program/ad804cb0-afa7-4688-802e-6b026823e32d/embed" style="min-height: 500px; min-width: 400px; border: none; "></iframe>
    <br><br>

    <h2>Ashley vs Fish Match 2 - with FUNCTIONS</h2>
    <p>Well well well, Ashley couldn't stay away and not only decided to race the fish AGAIN- but also bring functions into this. This race of course was held in the "100% made in Javascript" ball park on Java ave and HTML atreet. (Cick restart if you want to rewatch the race and maybe get different results.)</p>

    <br><br>

    <h2>Ashley does something different... with different sized clones?</h2>
    <p>Uhhhh story for this: Ashley was playing with the functions rock, and she became made of functions. From there she like called herself multiple times with different numbered parameters and now we have a bunch of different sizes of Ashley. This is what she got afterakk from drinking in the "100% made in Javascript pond of awesome."</p>

    <h2>Ashley Exists on A Page Unless...</h2>
    <p>I gave this one a name as "Ashley Follow" doesn't have much a ring to it... BUUUT, use your mouse to drag a mini Ashley around the screen- but be careful- if you bring her to the left or right edge of the scheen- shegoes OUT OF BOUNDS :o . This made in 100% javascript program I had a little more fun with than some of the others. There is a way to get her out of bounds by clicking sooo you know... try it :p</p>

    <h2>Ashley Recommends you a Providence, RI Restaraunt!</h2>
    <p>Pretty simple, this little mini quiz helps decide where you should go to eat in Providence RI, there are 3 possible restauraunts to get from mini Ashley's recommendations. A bit simple, but this little 100% made in Javascript took me WAYYYY too long to make, but a rewarding finish. Of course there are many really good restauraunts to recommend in Providence RI, but enjoy these 3 options (or none).</p>

    <br><br>

    <h2>Ashley gives you a fortune!</h2>
    <p>In this silly little program, Ashley gives you a fortune based on some code she wrote in 100% javaScript, involving loops, random numbers, and more! Ashley had a bit too much fun making this program for no reason, so enjoy the quotes from video games, and the little genereic fortunes! (Hit restart for a new fortune :3c)</p>

    <br><br>

    <h2>Ashley's Dance Floor!</h2>
    <p>So, Ashley's 100% JavaScript Club all met up and had a little dance... that's where the story ends, but this is the first pure animation on this site sooooo... also say helo to "Evil Ashley," she has red hair and is like the opposite of Ashley... uhhhh no more lore.</p>

    <br><br>

    <h2>Ashley Tag!</h2>
    <p>"Hey- wanna play tag?" This lil silly game is a game where you click around the screen to tag the constantly moving Ashleys on screen (yes that's Ashley, plural), andwhen you click an Ashley, Ashleys clicked in the radius around your mouse are tagged and are out of the game. This 100% made in Javascript game took me way too long to figure out how to do properly ;w; (click restart to play again)</p>

    <br><br>

    <h2>The avatar is... an OBJECT NOW?!</h2>
    <p>That's right, Ashley's avatar (made in 100% Java Script) has become an object according to Java Script Laws of natural order. Behold- Ashley with a red shirt and no initial, Ashley with a yellow shirt and initials, and your average ashley in the back- but they're all using the same class and making Ashleys an object has made this possible to do easier in the future.</p>

    <br><br>

    <h2>Ashley's Contact List</h2>
    <p>Have you ever wondered who/what's in Ashley's contact list before? Unless you're my professors, probably not, but now- I bring to you Ashley's contact list that she made with 100% Java Script! Just click on a contact name, and see what their details are. (Note: for legal reasons, none of the contact information is of any real person, DO NOT attempt to contact them in the case someone ends up eventually taking sid contact information)</p>

    <br><br>

    <h2>Ashley's Tic Tac Toe!</h2>
    <p>Let me be real with you for a second: I really want to be a game develeoper> Real time over, now I have created Tic Tac Toe 100% in Javascript. I have added my style to as much of the code as I could, so hope you enjoy. Remember, hit restart at the bottom to restart the program when the game ends.</p>
    <iframe src="https://code-lab.app/program/ae80ef21-a488-4da3-9c80-fda0863e8a12/embed" style="min-height: 500px; min-width: 400px; border: none; "></iframe>
    <br><br>

    <h2>Pong</h2>
    <p>Yeah so I used my knowledge of Javascript to work on Pong. I of course had to add some pink to Pong, and worked on this through 100% Javascript methods. Use the up and down arrows on your keyboard to play!</p>

    <br><br>
    
    <h2>Flappy Ashley!!!</h2>
    <p>Well well well, Ashley's greatest nemisis, pipes have invaded her 100% made in Java Script pink realm. Help Aslhey flap around the screen to avoid the pipes! Click or hold any key to make Ashley go up!</p>

    <h2>Whack-A-Ram!!!</h2>
    <p>Well, this was my final project in CSC 106. This is a Whack-A-Mole style (or Whack-A-Mole-like if you prefer) game in which you click on rams coming out of holes to get points! (Whacking them). This was made in partnership with Bianca Rietkerk in 100% Javascript!!! I created 2 videos for this project explaining the game features and code! Check them out with these links: <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z50QENJn4ns">Game Functions Video</a> and <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HNPrk3fOj4">Game Code Explanation</a></p>
