    <h1>My CSC 106 Avatar!</h1>
    <p>Remember what I said in my about me section about my online persona? This is... not at all her- this is the little avatar I made for my csc 106 course! She's made 100% in java script :3c </p>

    <h2>Avatar Dance! (The Ashley Dance!)</h2>
    <p id="dancetext"> This little silly program makes my avatar dance around the scrren! As it stands, to get my avatar to move around, just hit the reset button! Of course, this lil silly dance is made in 100% Javascript. I will likely say that for every program going forward- I like saying that.</p>

    <h2>Ashley Racing a Fish?!</h2>
    <p>Well well well, Ashley and the fish finally decided to settle their differences by a good old fashioned race... The outcome of the race is random every time! Just hit the reset button, and the fish and Ashley will start to race again! ...100% MADE IN JAVASCRIPT- BOOM- I SAID IT- YEAH-</p>

    <h2>Ashley goes insane- I mean makes her avatar dance... WITH FUNCTIONS</h2>
    <p>Have you ever considered that sometimes things are long? ... I have, and we made them both longer and shorter by making the exact same program of my avatar dancing... but with Functions!!!! Same rules as before, click restart and watch my avatar do a lil dance, made of course in 100% Javascript, as the food people would say! </p>

    <br><br>

    <h2>Ashley vs Fish Match 2 - with FUNCTIONS</h2>
    <p>Well well well, Ashley couldn't stay away and not only decided to race the fish AGAIN- but also bring functions into this. This race of course was held in the "100% made in Javascript" ball park on Java ave and HTML atreet. (Cick restart if you want to rewatch the race and maybe get different results.)</p>

    <h2>Ashley does something different... with different sized clones?</h2>
    <p>Uhhhh story for this: Ashley was playing with the functions rock, and she became made of functions. From there she like called herself multiple times with different numbered parameters and now we have a bunch of different sizes of Ashley. This is what she got afterakk from drinking in the "100% made in Javascript pond of awesome."</p>

    <h2>Ashley Exists on A Page Unless...</h2>
    <p>I gave this one a name as "Ashley Follow" doesn't have much a ring to it... BUUUT, use your mouse to drag a mini Ashley around the screen- but be careful- if you bring her to the left or right edge of the scheen- shegoes OUT OF BOUNDS :o . This made in 100% javascript program I had a little more fun with than some of the others. There is a way to get her out of bounds by clicking sooo you know... try it :p</p>

    <h2>Ashley Recommends you a Providence, RI Restaraunt!</h2>
    <p>Pretty simple, this little mini quiz helps decide where you should go to eat in Providence RI, there are 3 possible restauraunts to get from mini Ashley's recommendations. A bit simple, but this little 100% made in Javascript took me WAYYYY too long to make, but a rewarding finish. Of course there are many really good restauraunts to recommend in Providence RI, but enjoy these 3 options (or none).</p>
